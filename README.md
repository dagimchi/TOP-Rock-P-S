# TOP-Rock-P-S

A JS Project as part of the odin project

## Project Description

A webpage featuring a simple game of Rock, paper, scissors with UI.

## Technology

- HTML
- CSS
- JS

## Skills Demonstrated

- Knowledge of scoping when it comes to variables either being locally or globally scoped.
- Declarative function use.
- Conditional statements use.
- Boolean and logical operators use.
- Returned values from expressions or operations.
- Counter variables use.
- For loops use.
- String methods use.
- Back ticks for strings and variable/expression evaluation.
- Callback functions use.
- Use of absolute and relative positioning.
- Flexbox one dimensional layouts.
- Subtle animation using transitions.
- Node selections and storing them in a variable using querySelectors.
- DOM manipulation by accessing properties of objects and creating elements via JS.
  - I created an img element, updated its src, and appended the node itself to a div.
- Creation and use of event handlers and passing in either a function expression or declarative function.
  - Knowing that the event handler function is the one that invokes said function is important.
- Use of forEach method applied to a nodelist.
- Use of functions to avoid repetition.
  - See the getImage function which gets invoked in every if condition in the playRound function.
- Use of event target which takes advantage of event delegation.
  - The click event is only applied to the container of btns and not the btns themselves as this is not necessary due to how bubbling works.

## Possible Future Implementations

- TAKE USER INPUT FOR HOW MANY ROUNDS THE USER WANTS TO PLAY
- Responsiveness
